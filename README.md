# d&d 5e in slack?
----------
slack-beepboop-dnd is a slack bot made to support groups who want to run d&d 5e sessions using slack

The dm can input a character sheet, like so

```irc
/set player fug hp 12
/set player fug wisdom 16
/set player fug proficiencies perception
```irc

Then at some point later the player can check perception
```irc
/check perception to see if there is anyone hiding behind that curtain
```irc

to see the result

```irc
You rolled _d20+3_ for a perception check (_see if anyone is hiding behind that curtain_) and got 9 (dice rolled were [6])
```irc
